        <p>   I grew up learning Spanish in school and found a lot of interest in hispanic culture.
            From kindergarten to my Freshman year <br> I enjoyed learning of holidays, music, art, fashion, food,
            and so on. It has a nostalgic place, but also genuine interest in all of its elements. </p>

    Self explanitory, Kathleen's, along with the other girl's contriutions to the ENIAC 
    were very admirable and inspirational. I could only hope to make progress as great as hers. 
    <br> I also aspire to be like the multitalented Debbie Harry, following her self-expression, 
    confidence, and artistic skills. </p>

        <p>...Am able to spend time alone at night doing artwork. Once the night sets in and the world calms down <br>
        it is much easier to think and concentrate. The dark skys paint new perspectives on the surrounding 
        world.   </p>

    <p> Music has always been an important part of my life, and helps connect me with  
    my family and friends. It's connection with  <br> fashion also helped me develop my self expression,
    shape my personality, and confidence. </p>
